# @partitions = _partition $depth, @segments;
#
# This function groups a list of segments (Text::Glob::Expand::Segment
# instances) by the brace-expression they came from, using their depth
# attributes to infer which segments go together.
#
# It works by discarding elements below the desired $depth value,
# and using the gaps to split the remainder into groups.
#
# For example, if we ignore the segments' string attribute for the
# moment and just consider their depths, given an expression like
# this:
#
#     a{a{a,a}a}a{a}a{a{a}a}a
#
# We get depths like this:
#
#     @segments = (0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0)
#
# and results like this:
#

#    _partition 1, @segments # -> ([2, 2], [2])
#    _partition 2, @segments # -> ()

# Note, this is designed to be used internally by the ->_transform

# $root = $obj->_transform($depth, $permutation)
#
# $permutation is an arrayref of segments (Text::Glob::Expand::Segment
# instances) representing a permutation generated from a
# Text::Glob::Expand expression (i.e. one of the elements in the
# result from from _traverse).
#
# $depth is a depth to partition it by (in hindsight, perhaps this
# could be computed from the first element's depth?).
#
# The result $root is the root node of a tree structure describing the
# structure of the permutation (a Text::Glob::Expand::Permutation
# instance), by using the segments' depth attribute.  This tree is
# designed to allow the placeholders in formats to be mapped to
# expansions.
#
# Each node of the tree is an arrayref, and represents a
# brace-expression which contributes a string to this permutation
# (except for the root node, which is the entire expression).
#
# The indexing of tree-nodes corresponds to indexing of braces in the
# expansion: so the third brace in the second brace in the fifth brace
# in the glob corresponds to the node returned by $root->[5][2][3]
#
# The first element of a node arrayref is the node value, and the rest
# are sub-trees for any nested braces with the same recursive
# structure (i.e. [$value, @subtrees] - or just [$value] in leaf
# nodes).  So $root->[5][2][3][0] gets the string contribution from
# the brace in the previous example.
#
# e.g The glob "a{b{c,d,}e,f}g" expands to a set of permutations:
#
#    "abceg", "abdeg", "abeg", "afg"
#
# Expressing the first permutation in terms of segments with depth
# information (but omitting blessings), we have what would be input to
# this function:
#
#    $permutation = [['a', 0], ['b', 1], ['c', 2], ['e', 1], ['g', 0]]
#
# The output of $obj->_transform(0, $permutation) is then:
#
#    ["abceg", ["bce", ["c"]]]
#
# So "%1 %1.1 %1.1.1" gives "abcdeg bce c"
#
# Note that not all braces contribute to all permutations, so you must
# be careful when expanding format strings.  Therefore although there is a
# brace corresponding to %1.1 in the first permutation, there is none
# in the final one (in other words, "afg" _transforms to ["afg",
# ["f"]]).

=head1 NAME

Text::Glob::Expand - permute and expand glob-like text patterns


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Text::Glob::Expand version 0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

The original use case was to specify hostname aliases and expansions
thereof.  For example, it supports basic expansion of the glob
expression into its permutations like this:

    use Text::Glob::Expand;

    my $hosts = "{www{1,2,3},mail{1,2},ftp{1,2}}";
    my $glob = Text::Glob::Expand->parse($hosts);

    my $permutations = $glob->explode;
    # result is: [qw(www1 www2 www3 mail1 mail2 ftp1 ftp2)]


But additionally, to generate full hostnames, it supports a method to
expand these permutations using a format string:

    my $permutations = $glob->explode_format("%0.somewhere.co.uk");

    # result is:
    # {
    #     www1 => 'www1.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     www2 => 'www2.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     www3 => 'www3.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     mail1 => 'mail1.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     mail2 => 'mail2.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     ftp1 => 'ftp1.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     ftp2 => 'ftp2.somewhere.co.uk',
    # }


=head1 INTERFACE


=head2 C<< $obj = $class->parse($string) >>

This is the constructor.  It implements a simple state-machine to
parse the expression in C<$string>, and returns a
C<Text::Glob::Expand> object.

You don't really need to understand the structure of this object, just
invoke methods on it.  However, see L</"PARSING RULES"> for more
details of the expression and the internal structure of the object
returned.

=head2 C<< $arrayref = $obj->explode >>

This returns an arrayref containing all the expanded permutations
generated from the string parsed by the constructor.

(The result is cached, and returned again if this is called more than
once.  See C<$MAX_CACHING>.)

=head2 C<< $hashref = $obj->explode_format($format) >>

This returns a hashref mapping each expanded permutation to a string
generated from the C<$format> parameter.

(The return value is not cached, since the result depends on C<$format>.)


=head1 PARSING RULES

Using a notation based on a subset of the Backus Naur Form described
by the
L<http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec2.html#sec2.1|HTTP
1.1 RFC> (with the notable exception that white-space is significant
here) the expression syntax expected by the C<< ->parse >> method can
be defined like this:

    expression =
       segment *( brace-expression segment )

A I<segment> is a sequence of zero or more characters or
escaped-characters (i.e. braces and commas must be escaped with a
preceding backslash).

    segment =
       *( escaped-character | <any character except glob-characters> )

Where:

    escaped-character =
       "\" <any char>

    glob-character =
       "{" | "}" | ","

A I<brace-expression> is a sequence of one or more I<expressions>
(which in this context I call 'alternatives'), delimited by commas,
and enclosed in braces.

    brace-expression =
       "{" expression ( "," expression )* "}"


=head1 OBJECT STRUCTURE

An expression such as described in the previous above is parsed into
an arrayref of text I<segments> (represented with
C<Text::Glob::Expand::Segment> instances) and I<brace-expressions>
(represented by arrayrefs).

An I<expression> is represented at the top level by a
C<Text::Glob::Expand> instance, which is a blessed arrayref containing
only C<Text::Glob::Expand::Segment> instances and I<brace-expression>
arrayrefs.

Each I<brace-expression> array contains a list of the
brace-expression's 'alternatives' (the comma-delimited sub-expressions
within the braces).  These are represented by arrayrefs. Apart
from being unblessed, they otherwise have the same structure as the
top-level expression.

C<Text::Glob::Expand::Segment> instances are blessed arrayrefs,
composed of a string plus an integer (>= 0) indicating the number of
brace-pairs enclosing the segment.  The depth is used internally to
preserve the expression structure, and may be ignored by the user.
(See also L<Text::Glob::Expand::Segment>.)


For example, an expression such as:

    "a{b,{c,d}e,}g"

Will be parsed into something analogous to this structure (for better
readability I use a simplified Perl data-structure in which segments
are represented by simple strings instead of blessed arrays, and use
comments to denote types):

    [ # expression
      'a', # segment depth 0
      [ # brace
        [ # expression
          'b' # segment, depth 1
        ],
        [ # expression
          '', # segment, depth 1
          [ # brace
            [ # expression
              'c' # segment, depth 2
            ],
            [ # expression
              'd' # segment, depth 2
            ],
          ],
          'e' # segment, depth 1
        ],
        [ # expression
          '' # segment, depth 1
        ]
      ],
      'g', # segment, depth 0
    ]




=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The following parsing diagnostics should never actually occur. If they
do it means the internal data structure or code design is
inconsistent.  In this case, please file a bug report with details of
how to replicate the error.

=over 4

=item "unexpected scalar..."

=item "no such state..."

=item "no handler for state '...' looking at '...' pos '...'"

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

C<Text::Glob::Expand> requires no configuration files or environment
variables.

There is one configurable option in the form of a package variable, as
follows.

=head2 C<$MAX_CACHING>

The package variable C<$Text::Glob::Expand::MAX_CACHING> can be used
to control or disable the caching done by the C<< ->explode >> method.
It should be a positive integer, or zero.

The default value is 100, which means that up to 100
C<Text::Glob::Expand> objects' C<< ->explode >> results will be
cached, but no more.  You can disable caching by setting this to zero
or less.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The dependencies should be minimal - I aim to have none.

For a definitive answer, see the Build.PL file included in the
distribution, or use the dependencies tool on
L<http://search.cpan.org>


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Currently the parser will infer closing brackets at the end of an
expression if they are omitted. Probably a syntax error should be
thrown instead.

Also, extra closing brackets with no matching opening bracket will
generate an error.  This is a bug which will be addressed in future
versions.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-Text-Glob-Expand@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
