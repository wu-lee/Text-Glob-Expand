=head1 NAME

Text::Glob::Expand - permute and expand glob-like text patterns


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Text::Glob::Expand version 0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

The original use case was to specify hostname aliases and expansions
thereof.  For example:

    use Text::Glob::Expand;

    my $hosts = "{www{1,2,3},mail{1,2},ftp{1,2}}";
    my $glob = Text::Glob::Expand->parse($hosts);

    my $permutations = $glob->explode("%1.somewhere.co.uk");
    # $permutations = [qw(www1 www2 www3 mail1 mail2 ftp1 ftp2)]

    my $permutations = $glob->explode_format("%0.somewhere.co.uk");
    # $permutations = {
    #     www1 => 'www1.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     www2 => 'www2.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     www3 => 'www3.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     mail1 => 'mail1.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     mail2 => 'mail2.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     ftp1 => 'ftp1.somewhere.co.uk',
    #     ftp2 => 'ftp2.somewhere.co.uk',
    # }
  
=head1 INTERFACE 


=head2 C<< $obj = $class->parse($string) >>

This is the constructor.  It parses a string, and returns a
C<Text::Glob::Expand> object.

=head2 C<< $arrayref = $obj->explode >>

This returns an arrayref containing all the expanded permutations
generated from the string parsed by the constructor.

(The result is cached, and returned again if this is called more than
once.  See C<$MAX_CACHING>.)

=head2 C<< $hashref = $obj->explode_format($format) >>

This returns a hashref mapping each expanded permutation to a string
generated from the C<$format> parameter.

(The return value is not cached, since the result depend on C<$format>.)


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

TBD

=for author to fill in:
    List every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

C<Text::Glob::Expand> requires no configuration files or environment variables.

There is one configurable option in the form of a package variable.

=head2 C<$MAX_CACHING>

The package variable C<$Text::Glob::Expand::MAX_CACHING> can be used
to control or disable the caching done by the C<< ->explode >> method.
It should be a positive integer, or zero.

The default value is 100, which means that up to 100
C<Text::Glob::Expand> objects' C<< ->explode >> results will be
cached, but no more.  You can disable caching by setting this to zero
or less.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The dependencies should be minimal - I aim to have none.

For a definitive answer, see the Build.PL file included in the
distribution, or use the dependencies tool on
L<http://search.cpan.org>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
    competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
    limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=for author to fill in:
    A list of known problems with the module, together with some
    indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
    release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
    does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
    and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
    limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
    (yet) handled, etc.

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-Text-Glob-Expand@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
