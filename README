NAME
    Text::Glob::Expand - permute and expand glob-like text patterns

VERSION
    This document describes Text::Glob::Expand version 0.1

SYNOPSIS
    The original use case was to specify hostname aliases and expansions
    thereof. For example:

        use Text::Glob::Expand;

        my $hosts = "{www{1,2,3},mail{1,2},ftp{1,2}}";
        my $glob = Text::Glob::Expand->parse($hosts);

        my $permutations = $glob->explode("%1.somewhere.co.uk");
        # $permutations = [qw(www1 www2 www3 mail1 mail2 ftp1 ftp2)]

        my $permutations = $glob->explode_format("%0.somewhere.co.uk");
        # $permutations = {
        #     www1 => 'www1.somewhere.co.uk',
        #     www2 => 'www2.somewhere.co.uk',
        #     www3 => 'www3.somewhere.co.uk',
        #     mail1 => 'mail1.somewhere.co.uk',
        #     mail2 => 'mail2.somewhere.co.uk',
        #     ftp1 => 'ftp1.somewhere.co.uk',
        #     ftp2 => 'ftp2.somewhere.co.uk',
        # }

INTERFACE
  "$obj = $class->parse($string)"
    This is the constructor. It parses a string, and returns a
    "Text::Glob::Expand" object.

  "$arrayref = $obj->explode"
    This returns an arrayref containing all the expanded permutations
    generated from the string parsed by the constructor.

    (The result is cached, and returned again if this is called more than
    once. See $MAX_CACHING.)

  "$hashref = $obj->explode_format($format)"
    This returns a hashref mapping each expanded permutation to a string
    generated from the $format parameter.

    (The return value is not cached, since the result depend on $format.)

DIAGNOSTICS
    TBD

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    "Text::Glob::Expand" requires no configuration files or environment
    variables.

    There is one configurable option in the form of a package variable.

  $MAX_CACHING
    The package variable $Text::Glob::Expand::MAX_CACHING can be used to
    control or disable the caching done by the "->explode" method. It should
    be a positive integer, or zero.

    The default value is 100, which means that up to 100
    "Text::Glob::Expand" objects' "->explode" results will be cached, but no
    more. You can disable caching by setting this to zero or less.

DEPENDENCIES
    The dependencies should be minimal - I aim to have none.

    For a definitive answer, see the Build.PL file included in the
    distribution, or use the dependencies tool on <http://search.cpan.org>

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    No bugs have been reported.
